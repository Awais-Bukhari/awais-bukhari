    I was born in a small village named 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Jia Bagga in Lahore</span>. 
    At the age of about 3, my family moved to 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Township Lahore</span>, 
    where I lived for nearly 13 years. Later, during class 8th, we moved back to 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Jia Bagga near Raiwind</span>, 
    where I completed my 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Matriculation and Intermediate</span>.
    <br /><br />

    After Intermediate, I took a 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;1-year break</span> 
    from studies. During this time, I completed a 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Front-End Development course at Sherijan Coding School</span>, 
    followed by the 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Delta Web Development Course</span>, 
    where I learned backend and frontend technologies using 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Node.js</span> and 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Express.js</span>. 
    One of my key projects was building 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;WanderLust</span>, 
    a travel app clone inspired by popular booking platforms.
    <br /><br />

    Later, I enrolled in a degree in 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</span>, 
    where I chose the development path to focus on software and web applications. 
    During my first and second semesters, I completed the 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Full-Stack Development course on Scrimba via Coursera</span>, 
    and later earned the 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Professional React Specialization by Scrimba</span>, 
    taught by instructor 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Bob Ziroll</span>.
    <br /><br />

    Currently, I am expanding my skills through 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Hitesh Choudhary’s Web Development course</span>, 
    while continuing my 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;self-learning journey</span>. 
    My main expertise lies in 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;MERN Stack Development</span>.
    <br /><br />

    Over the years, I’ve achieved certifications in 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Full-Stack Development</span> 
    and 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Professional React</span>. 
    I have also built notable projects like the 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;VanLife App</span> 
    (a van rental web app), 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;WanderLust</span>, 
    and an 
    <span className="text-white underline">&nbsp;Assembly Game</span> using React.
    <br /><br />

    <span className="text-white italic">
      With a blend of structured courses, real-world projects, and continuous self-learning, 
      I strive to build meaningful and impactful web applications that bring ideas to life. 🚀
